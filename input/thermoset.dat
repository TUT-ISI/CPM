! Options for the thermodynamic model 3
! -------------------------------------

! a) General options
&EQSolver
   UseAbsoluteTolerance    = T,		! Either absolute or relative tolerance for equilibrium calculations
     FirstEqRelTolerance   = 1.0E-22,	! First equilibrium. Stop iteration when Tol > (1-prod(a_i)/Keq)^2
     LaterEqRelTolerance   = 1.0E-24,	! Later equilibriums
     FirstEqAbsTolerance   = 1.0E-12,	! Stop iteration when max uncertainty in concentrations less than Tol*C
     LaterEqAbsTolerance   = 1.0E-8,	! Later equilibriums
   MaxIterationNumber      = 5000,	! Equilibrium is usually found within a couple hundred rounds
   ActivityCoefficentModel = 1, 	! 1=Clegg, 2=Clegg (25 C), 3=Pitzer (different parameters set), 8=ideal solution
   MaxKelvin               = 1000.0,	! If less than or equal to 1.0, Kelvin effect is ignored
   DisplayInputReport      = F		! Prints information about equilibrium and activity parameters (debugging)

! b) Options for selecting initial equilibriums for water and organics
&InitialOrganicEquilibriums
   WaterGasLiquid         = T,	! Water gas-liquid euilibrium
     OpenWaterGasPhase    = F,	! Open/closed gas phase for water
   OrganicSolidLiquid     = T,	! Organics solid-liquid equilibrium 
     OrganicSLEMethod     = 1,	! Solubility from: 1=saturation mole fraction, 2=saturation activity
   FirstSolidsToLiquids   = T,	! All soluble organics are set to liquids. Can be used if composition given as solid, but solubility calculations are not needed
   OrganicGasLiquid       = F,	! Organics gas-liquid equilibrium
     OrganicVLEMethod     = 1,	! Gas solubility from: 1=Henry's law coefficients, 2=saturation vapor pressure
     OpenOrganicGasPhase  = F,	! Open/closed gas phase for water
&EndInitialOrganicEquilibriums


! c) Options for selecting initial equilibriums for inorganics
&InitialInorganicEquilibriums
   SaltSolidLiquid        = F,	! Inorganics solid-liquid equilibrium
   FirstSolidsToLiquids   = T,	! All soluble salts are set to ions. Can be used if composition given as solid salt
   IonIonEquilibrium      = T,	! Ion-ion equilibrium, e.g. HSO4- <-> H+ + SO4--
   WaterDissociation      = F,	! H2O <-> H+ + OH-
   InorgGasIon            = T,	! Gas-ion equilibrium, e.g. HNO3(g) <-> H+ + NO3-
   Inorganic2Gas2Ion      = T,	! Additional equilibrium for two gases, e.g. NH3(g)+HNO3(g) <-> NH4+ + NO3-
   InorgGasLiquid         = T,	! Gas-liquid equilibrium, e.g. CO2(g) <-> CO2(l)
   InorganicLiquidIon     = F,	! Liquid-ion equilibrium, e.g. HNO3(l) <-> H+ + NO3-  
   OpenInorganicGasPhase  = F,	! Open/closed gas phase for inorganic gases

! d) If equilibrium model converges very slowly or not at all, these otions can improve model performance.
!    These parameters have no effect on calculated results, but they are used when thermodynamic equilibrium
!    is calculated iteratively. For example, if WaterLimitRounds is greater than zero, water concentration 
!    changes are limited by multiplying those with factor WaterLimit (less than one) during first 
!    WaterLimitRounds iteration rounds. Inorganics salts are an exception, because their equilibriums are
!    ignored before iteration round SaltLimitRounds, and limit is used after that.
!
!  1) Initial equilibrium (may be usefull for difficult systems)
&InitEqOptions
   TestConvergency  = F,	! Program checks that iteration converges, and increases limits if needed
   WaterLimitRounds = 100,
     WaterLimit     = 0.5E0,
   GasesLimitRounds = 0,
     GasesLimit     = 0.2E0,
   IonLimitRounds   = 0,
     IonLimit       = 0.5E0,
   SaltLimitRounds  = 0,
     SaltLimit      = 1.0E0,
&EndInitEqOptions

!  2) Later equilibriums (rarely needed)
&LaterEqOptions
   TestConvergency  = F,
   IonLimitRounds   = 0,
     IonLimit       = 0.9E0,
   SaltLimitRounds  = 0,
