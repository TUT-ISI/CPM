Limits to freezing probability (if below lower_limit ->
freezin probability = 0 and if over upper_limit -> prob = 1)
&Probability
   upper_limit = 0.99
   ower_limit = 1.0d-6

This option is for the DtOutIce (time step to be used during the freezing). 
Because the probability can be limited (above), the time step activates when 
freezing starts. In some cases, this is ok but here is an option that allows
the DtOutIce activate when probability for freezing is over 0 and the limits
are off (for this option). 1 = limits on, 2 = limits off
&IceStepStart
   ice_step_start = 2
$EndIceStepStart

dr_c = Limit for rational freezing in program ice_bin_divider [#/cm3]
freez_cons_lo = limit for making a new solid bin [#/cm3]
C_min_limit = limit for number consentration to activate ice model [#/cm3]
y_min_limit = limit for liquid phase consentration [#/cm3] for ice
modulus to activate (in one size class). This option makes the model
more stable.
&Divider
   dr_c = 1.d-25
   freez_cons_lo = 1.d-20
   C_min_limit = 1.d-4

* method_HNO3 = 1 -> HNO3 to iceparticles, adsorption off
  method_HNO3 = 2 -> HNO3 to gasphase, adsorption off
  method_HNO3 = 3 -> HNO3 to iceparticles, adsorption on
  method_HNO3 = 4 -> HNO3 to gasphase, adsorption on
* Equilibrium adsorption constant (K_eq) method:
  method_K_eq = 1 -> Popp et al. (constant dH_ads)
  method_K_eq = 2 -> Cox et.al
  method_K_eq = 3 -> Ullerstam et.al
  method_K_eq = 4 -> Tabazadeh et al. -> improved method by Krämer et al.
  (temperature dependent dG_ads) DON'T USE THIS!!!
* surfdensity_HNO3 is the amount of HNO3 molecules in complete monolayer
  [molecules/m2]
* idiss_ads = 1 -> Langmuir's isotherm dissociative
  idiss_ads = 2 -> Langmuir's isotherm non-dissociative
* stick_hno3_ads is accommodation coefficient for HNO3 (adsorption only, highly experimental)
